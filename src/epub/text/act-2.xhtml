She is alone in the room, walking about uneasily. She stops by the sofa and takes up her cloak.</p>

I may as well tell you plainly, we were once on very intimate terms with one another. But this tactless fellow lays no restraint on himself when other people are present. On the contrary, he thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with me, and every minute it is ‘I say, Helmer, old fellow!’ and that sort of thing. I assure you it is extremely painful for me. He would make my position in the Bank intolerable.</td>
